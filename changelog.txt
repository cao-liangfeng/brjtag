The latest version is 1.9o (2010.11.13)

Change Log

1.9o
- added STM32F based hid-brjtag v2 supporting
- hid-brjtag v1.03 rom is ready supporting long IR

1.9m
- added ATMega8 based hid-brjtag v1 supporting. Mcu hardware use existed USBASP, see http://www.fischl.de/


1.9L
- added a new cpu BCM7401
- added a new flash, M29W128G (0x017E, 0x3701) 16MB uniform.


1.9k
- 1.9j did not work under 64bits Windows. An independent 64bits version should be released in future.
- Optimized timing of USB cable. stability and speed both improved.
- updated USB cable build-in profile
      /L9:1  Setting for safe mode access old devices, such as BCM4710
      /L9:2  for quick whole chip backup, about 20% speed improvement.
- added another access method to parallel port under windows, active option with /io2.
  found some BCM5354 flash/backup in win7 have 4 bytes address shift, wish /io2 can help on.


1.9j
- Windows driver for parallel cable spin to WinIo 3.0, fully support 32b/64b win2000/xp/vista/win7/win2008.
  /os64 option must added under 64bit windows
  WinIo W/R efficiency is perfect, give up supporting giveio and inpout32

- added nSRST signal support for simple parallel DLC5 cable, need 100ohm resister connect to DB25 pin7
  /srst option can take a  HW reset via JTAG on starting

- /ejslow option can improve flash write stability for USB cable.


1.9h
- added 5354 chip init code
  /initcpu

1.9g3
- added x8 mode flashing support
  /wx8
  if dma mode can't program correctly, try a parallel cable and pracc mode
  /wx8 /nodma

1.9f
- Added support for J-link arm usb emulator
- further optimize the usb jtager R/W performance

1.9e

1.8c

-updated cpu identify routine.

1.8b

- updated 3 cycles flash ID detect routine.

1.8a
- new added CFI flash type query. Great function, should be work with most of x16 Parallel flash,
  /nocfi use stored flash list
  /forceflip and /forcenoflip use to manual set the cfi queried erase block geometry
  (not tested with SST and Intel chip)
- added Intel chip and SST chip /erasechip function
  -probeonly /erasechip

1.7u
- fixed code prevent from hanging at   "Halting Processor ... <Processor did NOT enter Debug Mode!> ... Done"
- Added a solution while the worst lock, can't enter debug mode.

1.7t

- DMA access routine update

1.7s

- /nompi switch skip MPI register autodetect
- improved /fc:xxx , /window:xxxxxxx /erasechip combination usage


1.7r

- fixed a Intel type flash Program bug introduced by 1.7p. 
- Added strictly boundary alignment check for Erase/Program
- fixed a Intel type bug when Program with /noerase switch

1.7p

- fixed tiny CFE size calculation method, max(bottom sector size, 64KB)

1.7m

- fixed -probeonly /erasechip support for all AMD command type flash
- Added EON, MXIC, ST most 4MB, 8MB and 16MB AMD cmd type flash ID


1.7j

- Added new flash dev id for some ST, EON 4MB,8MB and 16MB
- Added /ejtag0 switch to delay 20ns after each jtag shift cycle,
   wish this can improve LPT compatiability of some high clock PC
- Added /pracc0 switch to recall the orignal HD's PrAcc NODMA access routine.
