1. hid-brjtag mcu rom 1.03

This rom works with usbasp hardware, main mcu chip is ATMEL ATmega 8. source compile need a opensource tool WINAVR for windows. I am using WinAVR-20100110-install.exe. After installing WINAVR, load project in Programmer's Notepad, tools->make clen, then tools->make program.   main.hex is ready for download to usbasp

2. Brjtag 1.9o on windows

The compiler is choosen MS vc++ 6.0 or later. Only need command line cl.exe. Free version vs.net can be download  from MS website.

open a cmd window in source folder, run zl.bat

libusb-win32 filter driver is required for j-link and hid-brjtag. if brjtag need run on Vista or Win7, libusb-win32 version required later than 2010.5.5

ft2232 D2xx driver can get from www.ftdichip.com


3. Linux

usb supporting requires libusb legacy version 0.1.12
download D2xx for linux version 0.4.16 from http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/D2XX.htm
in driver package, libusb 0.1.12 is included.

step 1, compile and install libusb.
in libusb folder
./configure
./make
./make install
all libusb lib can found in /usr/local/lib

step 2, install d2xx lib
copy d2xxinstall shell scripts in un-taggz-ed d2xx driver folder and run.
./d2xxinstall
the scripts will copy ftdid2xx dynamic lib to /usr/local/lib, and create two soft links for link-time and run-time
check d2xx driver folder readme.dat
modify /etc/fstab

if using a kernel 2.6.xx
running occur: libftd2xx.so.0 cannot restore segment prot after reloc: Permission denied
try
chcon -t texrel_shlib_t /usr/local/lib/libftd2xx.*

in brjtag root folder
make all
can get both dynamic link and static link obj file.
dynamic obj:brjtag
static obj:brjtag.a

I have packed all static libs to brjtag/lnx sub folder, use
make static
to get static only obj. 
you can compile and run static obj without installing libusb and ftdid2xx libs.
